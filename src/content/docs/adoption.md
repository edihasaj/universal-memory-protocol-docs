title: "Adoption & roadmap"
description: "The path from draft to ecosystem: reference SDK/server, adapters, governance, and sequencing."
---


A standard is a GitHub repo until something speaks it. This is the concrete path
from draft to ecosystem, leaning on assets we already own.

---

## 1. Strategy in one line

Ship a working **reference SDK/server (`@ump/core`)** + **conformance suite**
first; use **Recall as the first rich production engine adapter**; make adoption
cost ~an afternoon via the MCP profile; wrap existing stores with adapters so UMP
delivers value with a *single* vendor on day one. Only then push for spec
ratification. (MCP did SDKs-before-spec-evangelism; copy it.)

---

## 2. Recall as the first production engine adapter

Recall already implements many L2/L3-grade memory engine behaviors. The work is
exposing those behaviors through UMP, not making Recall the protocol dependency.
Mapping:

| UMP | Recall today | Work |
|-----|--------------|------|
| `recall` op | `query` / compiler hybrid search | alias tool name + signal output shape |
| `remember` | `report_correction` / `capture_correction` | accept full record; keep pattern detection as ingest path |
| `revise` | supersession via `supersedes` field + contradiction resolve | expose as op |
| `forget` | `prune` / `reject` | add tombstone semantics + reason |
| `get` / `capabilities` | partial | thin additions |
| `feedback` | `feedback` / `signal_outcome` | rename to `ump.feedback` |
| kinds | rule/command/gotcha/decision/review_pattern | map → semantic/procedural/episodic |
| scope | session/path/repo/team/global | map → composite scope + visibility |
| provenance | evidence + capture_context + audit_trail | already PROV-shaped |
| consent | (gap) | add `consent` block; oktapod's retention classes as the model |
| integrity | sync_version (gap on crypto) | add DID owner + Ed25519 signing |
| MCP binding | full MCP server | add `ump.*` reserved tool names |
| HTTP binding | daemon `/compile` `/correct` … | add `/ump/*` aliases |
| file binding | CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / `.recall/context.md` | add `*.ump.json` + `*.ump.md` + `.well-known/ump.json` |

Deliverable: Recall ships an `--ump` mode advertising `UMP 0.1 / L2` (then L3),
proving the spec against a real memory engine while `@ump/core` remains the
neutral reference SDK/server.

## 3. Adapters (value with one vendor, day one)

Thin shims so UMP isn't all-or-nothing:

- **Claude Code / Codex** - already MCP hosts → point them at the Recall UMP
  server; SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit hooks call `ump.recall`, corrections call
  `ump.remember`. (Recall already wires these.)
- **openclaw** (`oss/openclaw`) - implement UMP behind its `ContextEngine`
  interface: `assemble()` → `ump.recall`, `afterTurn()` → `ump.remember`. One
  adapter file.
- **oktapod** - expose its memory facet over the UMP HTTP binding; its retention
  classes + provenance already match `consent`/`provenance`.
- **ChatGPT / generic chat** - UMP HTTP binding as a custom action / connector; or
  import/export `*.ump.json` to bridge ChatGPT "saved memories" in and out.
- **Wrap, don't replace** - Mem0/Letta/Zep adapters that translate their verbs to
  UMP ops, so UMP federates existing stores instead of competing with them.

## 4. Deliverables checklist

- [ ] `ump-spec` (this repo) - SPEC + JSON Schema for the record + test vectors.
- [ ] `ump-js` / `ump-py` SDKs - client + server helpers, MCP+HTTP+file bindings.
- [ ] Conformance suite - runs L0-L3 assertions against any endpoint; emits a badge.
- [ ] Recall `--ump` production engine adapter (L2 → L3).
- [ ] 2 adapters that interoperate (e.g. Recall ↔ openclaw) - proves portability.
- [ ] `.well-known/ump.json` discovery + a public example export.
- [ ] A "round-trip" demo: a memory written in Claude Code, recalled in Codex,
      exported to a file, re-imported into ChatGPT - the money shot.

## 5. Governance

- **Name:** **Universal Memory Protocol (UMP)**. Descriptive, adjacent to MCP,
  and clear about the missing interop layer: memory.
- **License:** Apache-2.0 for the spec, SDK/server, adapters, examples, and docs.
  Permissive, with an explicit patent grant.
- **Stewardship:** start single-author for velocity, but commit publicly to neutral
  governance early (a working group / foundation track) - the difference between a
  trusted standard and a distrusted vendor spec. MCP's perceived neutrality was
  decisive; an "open" spec that one company controls gets routed around.
- **RFC process:** publish v0.1 as an RFC; resolve SPEC §8 open questions with ≥2
  independent implementations before calling anything 1.0.

## 6. Sequencing

1. **v0.1 (now):** spec + JSON Schema + Recall `--ump` (L2) + one adapter. Internal dogfood.
2. **v0.2:** SDKs + conformance suite + the round-trip demo; publish RFC; recruit a
   second external implementer.
3. **v0.3:** L3 (signing, capability tokens, rehydration), `subscribe`,
   `.well-known` discovery; submit alongside MCP/A2A ecosystem conversations.
4. **1.0:** ≥2 interop implementations across vendors; freeze the record + ops;
   move governance to a neutral steward.

## 7. Remaining decisions

1. **Implementation split** - keep `@ump/core` as the minimal standalone
   reference server and Recall as one richer production implementation?
2. **Ambition tier** - (a) a tight interchange + MCP profile we ship fast, or
   (b) the full negotiated protocol with signing/capability tokens aiming at
   Anthropic/OpenAI adoption? (Spec is written for (b); we can ship (a) first.)
3. **Stewardship path** - when to move from single-repo velocity to a working
   group or foundation-style governance model.
