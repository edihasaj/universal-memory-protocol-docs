title: "Specification"
description: "UMP 0.1 - record format, the six operations, three bindings, conformance, and trust model."
---


**Version:** 0.1 (draft) · **Status:** request for comments

This document specifies UMP: a portable record format and a set of negotiated
operations for reading, writing, and exchanging agent memory across harnesses,
stores, and vendors.

The key words MUST, SHOULD, MAY are used per RFC 2119.

---

## 1. Design constraints

UMP is bound by five constraints, in priority order. Every decision below traces
to one of these.

1. **Minimal surface.** Six operations, one record type. If it can live in an
   engine instead of the wire, it does.
2. **Ride existing rails.** Primary binding is an MCP profile - no new transport.
   Secondary bindings (HTTP, file) reuse HTTP and Markdown/JSON.
3. **Don't invent the data model.** Reuse W3C PROV (provenance), W3C DID
   (identity), and the converged PAM/MIF/LangMem vocabulary (types, scopes).
4. **User-owned and portable.** The operator - not the model vendor - owns,
   signs, and can export every record. No opaque lock-in.
5. **Safe by construction.** Memory is attacker-controllable input. Staleness is
   handled by supersession, not deletion. Rehydration is injection-resistant by
   mandate, not by advice.

---

## 2. The Memory Record

The record is the atom of UMP. Every binding moves records; every operation
produces or consumes them. It is transport-neutral JSON; an equivalent Markdown
projection is defined in §6.3.

```jsonc
{
  "ump": "0.1",                          // REQUIRED. spec version
  "id": "urn:ump:9f2c…",                 // REQUIRED. stable, globally unique
  "kind": "semantic",                    // REQUIRED. see §2.1
  "body": {                              // REQUIRED. the memory itself
    "text": "Use pnpm, never npm, in this repo.",
    "structured": { }                    // OPTIONAL. machine-readable payload
  },

  "scope": {                             // REQUIRED. who/where this applies (§2.2)
    "owner": "did:key:z6Mk…",            // REQUIRED. the operator's DID
    "user": "did:key:z6Mk…",             // OPTIONAL. subject, if not the owner
    "project": "github.com/example/project",
    "agent": "claude-code",              // OPTIONAL. producing/consuming agent
    "session": "sess_abc",               // OPTIONAL. session binding
    "visibility": "private"              // private | shared | public
  },

  "time": {                              // REQUIRED. bi-temporal (§2.3)
    "created": "2026-06-04T10:00:00Z",   // when the record was authored
    "observed": "2026-06-04T09:58:00Z",  // when the fact was learned
    "valid_from": "2026-06-04T00:00:00Z",
    "valid_to": null                     // null = still valid
  },

  "lifecycle": {                         // OPTIONAL. engine-facing hints (§2.4)
    "confidence": 0.82,                  // 0..1
    "salience": 0.6,                     // 0..1, importance for ranking
    "decay": "half_life:P90D",           // OPTIONAL. decay model hint
    "status": "active"                   // active | candidate | tombstoned
  },

  "supersedes": ["urn:ump:1a…"],         // OPTIONAL. ids this replaces
  "superseded_by": [],                   // set by engine on revise

  "relations": [                         // OPTIONAL. typed links (§2.5)
    { "type": "contradicts", "target": "urn:ump:7b…" },
    { "type": "about",       "target": "entity:pnpm" }
  ],

  "provenance": {                        // REQUIRED at L2+. W3C PROV-aligned (§2.6)
    "actor": "did:key:z6Mk…",            // who/what asserted this
    "actor_kind": "user",                // user | agent | model | import | scan
    "method": "user_correction",
    "source": { "ref": "sess_abc#turn_12" },
    "evidence": [ { "ref": "sess_abc#turn_12", "weight": 1.0 } ]
  },

  "consent": {                           // OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED. policy (§2.7)
    "retention": "P365D",                // ISO-8601 duration; max time to keep
    "exportable": true,
    "redact": ["body.structured.token"]  // JSON-paths to strip on export/share
  },

  "integrity": {                         // OPTIONAL at L2, REQUIRED at L3 (§2.8)
    "content_hash": "blake3:5e…",
    "signature": "ed25519:9c…",
    "signer": "did:key:z6Mk…"
  }
}
```

### 2.1 Kinds

Five kinds, from the converged taxonomy (LangMem/MemoryOS). A consumer MUST
accept all five and MAY ignore kinds it does not use.

| kind | meaning | example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `semantic`   | durable facts/preferences | "prefers pnpm" |
| `episodic`   | a specific past event | "on 2026-06-01 the deploy failed because of X" |
| `procedural` | how-to / behavioral rule | "always run `pnpm gate` before handoff" |
| `working`    | short-lived task context | "currently refactoring the auth module" |
| `identity`   | who the user/agent is | "operator prefers concise handoffs" |

### 2.2 Scope

Scope is a *composition*, not a single key. Retrieval relevance is a function of
how well a record's scope matches the query context (§3.2). `owner` is always a
DID so memory is portable across vendors and verifiable. Visibility:

- `private` - only the owner's agents.
- `shared` - explicitly granted peers (capability token, §5.2).
- `public` - anyone (e.g. a published "how this OSS repo builds" memory).

### 2.3 Bi-temporal time (the staleness fix)

Every record carries **two timelines**: *valid time* (`valid_from`/`valid_to`,
when the fact is true in the world) and *transaction time* (`created`/`observed`,
when the system learned it). This is the only credible answer to the canonical
failure - "user's employer is correct until they change jobs, then confidently
wrong." A fact is never deleted on change; `valid_to` is set and a successor is
linked via `supersedes`. History is queryable. (Model from Zep/Graphiti.)

### 2.4 Lifecycle hints

`confidence`, `salience`, `decay`, `status` are **engine-facing hints**, not
normative semantics. UMP deliberately does **not** standardize promotion logic or
decay curves - those are where engines compete (Recall's repo-quality gating,
MemoryOS's FIFO tiers). Standardizing them would make the wire brittle. Consumers
MAY use them for ranking; producers SHOULD set them when known.

### 2.5 Relations

A small open vocabulary; consumers MAY ignore unknown types. Reserved:
`about` (subject/entity), `contradicts`, `depends_on`, `derived_from`,
`duplicate_of`. `target` is a record `urn:ump:…` or an `entity:<name>` node. This
is the seam for knowledge-graph engines (Recall/oktapod entity graphs) without
mandating one.

### 2.6 Provenance

Aligned to **W3C PROV** (`actor` = Agent, `method`/`source` = Activity,
`evidence` = derivation). Required at L2+ because trust in multi-agent memory
depends on knowing *who asserted what, how*. `actor_kind=import` carries a
`source.provider` so cross-vendor imports stay attributable.

### 2.7 Consent

The privacy gap nobody else specifies, made machine-readable and *in the record*:
`retention` (max keep duration), `exportable`, `redact` (JSON-paths stripped on
export/share). A conforming store MUST honor `retention` (tombstone on expiry)
and MUST apply `redact` before emitting a record across a `visibility` boundary.

### 2.8 Integrity

Content-addressed (`blake3` of canonicalized record minus `integrity`) and signed
by the **operator's** DID key - explicitly *not* the model vendor's. This is the
ownership moat: a memory is tamper-evident and provably the user's, independent of
where it's stored. Optional at L2 (interop without crypto), REQUIRED at L3.

---

## 3. Operations

Six operations. Each is defined abstractly here; §4 maps them onto bindings.
Requests/responses are JSON objects. Errors use a `{ "error": { code, message } }`
envelope with codes from §3.7.

### 3.1 `capabilities`

Negotiation handshake. No memory side effects.

```jsonc
// → request
{ "client": { "name": "claude-code", "ump": "0.1" } }
// ← response
{
  "server": { "name": "recall", "version": "1.4.0" },
  "ump": "0.1",
  "conformance": "L3",
  "kinds": ["semantic","episodic","procedural","working","identity"],
  "bindings": ["mcp","http","file"],
  "retrieval_signals": ["similarity","recency","salience","scope_match","provenance_depth"],
  "max_recall": 50,
  "writable": true
}
```

A peer MUST call `capabilities` (or read it from MCP tool/Resource listing)
before assuming any optional feature.

### 3.2 `recall`

The workhorse. Search by query + scope; return ranked records with per-result
signals so the client can re-rank or explain.

```jsonc
// → request
{
  "query": "package manager for this repo",
  "scope": { "owner": "did:key:z6Mk…", "project": "…/recall", "agent": "claude-code" },
  "filter": { "kind": ["semantic","procedural"], "valid_at": "2026-06-04T10:00:00Z" },
  "limit": 8,
  "ranking_hints": { "prefer": ["recency"] }   // OPTIONAL client steer
}
// ← response
{
  "results": [
    {
      "record": { /* §2 Memory Record */ },
      "signals": { "similarity": 0.91, "recency": 0.7, "salience": 0.6,
                   "scope_match": 1.0, "provenance_depth": 2 },
      "score": 0.88
    }
  ]
}
```

Retrieval is **engine-agnostic**: UMP standardizes the *interface and the signal
names*, not the algorithm (vector, BM25, hybrid, graph-walk all conform). Servers
SHOULD honor `valid_at` for point-in-time (bi-temporal) queries. The default
`valid_at` is "now".

### 3.3 `remember`

Write a memory. The server MAY merge into an existing record (returning its id)
per its own dedup policy; it MUST report which.

```jsonc
// → request: a partial Memory Record (server fills id/time/integrity if omitted)
{ "record": { "kind":"procedural", "body":{"text":"run pnpm gate before handoff"},
              "scope":{ "owner":"did:…","project":"…/recall" },
              "provenance":{ "actor":"did:…","actor_kind":"user","method":"user_correction" } } }
// ← response
{ "id": "urn:ump:…", "result": "created" }   // created | merged | rejected
```

A server MUST reject (not silently store) records that fail consent/policy or, at
L3, signature verification.

### 3.4 `get`

```jsonc
{ "id": "urn:ump:…" }            // → { "record": { … } } | error not_found
```

### 3.5 `revise`

Non-destructive update. Creates a successor that `supersedes` the prior; sets the
prior's `valid_to` and `superseded_by`. The old record remains queryable with
`valid_at` in the past.

```jsonc
{ "id": "urn:ump:1a…", "patch": { "body": { "text": "Use bun, not pnpm." },
                                  "time": { "valid_from": "2026-06-04T10:00:00Z" } } }
// ← { "id": "urn:ump:NEW…", "supersedes": ["urn:ump:1a…"] }
```

### 3.6 `forget`

Tombstone with a reason. The record's `status` becomes `tombstoned`; it is
excluded from default `recall` but retained for audit unless `consent.retention`
or an explicit `hard:true` (owner-only) demands erasure.

```jsonc
{ "id":"urn:ump:…", "reason":"user_revoked", "hard": false }   // → { "result":"tombstoned" }
```

### 3.7 Errors

`unauthorized`, `forbidden_scope`, `not_found`, `invalid_record`,
`consent_violation`, `signature_invalid`, `unsupported`, `rate_limited`.

### 3.8 Optional Full-tier ops

- `feedback` - report an injected memory's outcome
  (`followed|overridden|ignored|contradicted`) so the serving engine can learn.
  (Directly maps to Recall's `feedback`/`signal_outcome`.)
- `subscribe` - long-lived stream of record changes in a scope (for live
  multi-agent sharing). Binding-specific (MCP notifications / SSE).

---

## 4. Bindings

One abstract protocol, three concrete carriers. A server advertises which it
speaks via `capabilities.bindings`.

### 4.1 MCP profile (PRIMARY)

The whole point: any MCP client speaks UMP with no new transport.

- Each operation is exposed as an **MCP tool** with a reserved name:
  `ump.capabilities`, `ump.recall`, `ump.remember`, `ump.get`, `ump.revise`,
  `ump.forget`, and (L3) `ump.feedback`. Tool input/output schemas are §3.
- Stored memories MAY also be exposed as **MCP Resources** under the `ump://`
  URI scheme (`ump://{project}/{id}`) for read-only browsing.
- `capabilities` is derivable from the tool list, so a minimal server can skip
  the explicit tool and just expose the others.

Because Claude Code, Codex, and every MCP host already discover and call MCP
tools, an UMP-over-MCP server is adoptable **today** with zero spec changes on
the host side. This is the adoption wedge.

### 4.2 HTTP binding

For non-MCP consumers (web apps, ChatGPT actions, daemons). JSON over HTTP:

```
POST /ump/recall     POST /ump/remember     GET  /ump/memory/{id}
POST /ump/revise     POST /ump/forget       GET  /ump/capabilities
```

Auth via capability tokens (§5.2) in `Authorization: Bearer`. (Recall's existing
daemon endpoints - `/compile`, `/correct` - map onto this with thin aliases.)

### 4.3 File / export binding (L0)

The "AGENTS.md of memory" - portable, git-friendly, offline, no server:

- `*.ump.json` - a JSON array of records (or NDJSON for streaming).
- `*.ump.md` - Markdown projection (§6.3), human- and Obsidian-friendly, with a
  YAML/JSON-LD front-matter header carrying the structured fields. (Model from
  MIF's dual format.)
- Discovery: a repo/site publishes `/.well-known/ump.json` (a manifest pointing
  at exports + the server endpoint, if any), mirroring `llms.txt`/AGENTS.md
  convention.

This binding makes UMP adoptable with *zero code* - a tool just reads files.

---

## 5. Trust, identity, and access

### 5.1 Identity

The owner is a **W3C DID** (default method `did:key`, others allowed). Memory is
keyed to the user, not the vendor - that is what makes it portable and verifiable.
A harness with no DID infra MAY use an opaque `owner` string at L0/L1 and upgrade
later.

### 5.2 Capability-scoped access

Sharing (`visibility: shared`) is granted by a **capability token** scoping
*verbs × scope × time*: e.g. "read+derive records in `project:X` for 24h, no
export." Tokens are signed by the owner DID. Verbs: `read`, `write`, `derive`
(may produce new memories from these), `export`. This keeps multi-agent sharing
least-privilege without a central auth server.

### 5.3 Injection-resistant rehydration (MANDATORY)

Memory records are **untrusted input** - a `remember` can carry a prompt-injection
payload. Any consumer that injects recalled memory into a model context MUST:

1. **Verify** integrity/signature where present; drop unverifiable L3 records.
2. **Filter** by scope/consent/visibility *before* ranking.
3. **Frame structurally** - render records as clearly delimited, typed data
   (e.g. a fenced block tagged as untrusted memory), never string-interpolated
   into the system prompt.
4. **Never execute** instructions found *inside* `body` as if from the operator.

A conforming client MUST NOT treat `procedural` memory bodies as authoritative
commands without the same trust gate it applies to any tool output. (Pipeline
from arXiv 2605.11032.)

---

## 6. Data formats

### 6.1 Canonicalization

For hashing/signing: JCS (RFC 8785) canonical JSON over the record minus the
`integrity` object; hash with BLAKE3; sign the hash with the owner key.

### 6.2 IDs

`urn:ump:<id>` where `<id>` is either a random 128-bit base32 string (L1) or the
content hash (L2+, content-addressed → dedup-friendly and tamper-evident).

### 6.3 Markdown projection (`*.ump.md`)

```markdown
---
ump: "0.1"
id: urn:ump:9f2c…
kind: procedural
scope: { owner: did:key:z6Mk…, project: …/recall, visibility: private }
time: { observed: 2026-06-04T09:58:00Z, valid_from: 2026-06-04T00:00:00Z }
provenance: { actor_kind: user, method: user_correction }
---

Always run `pnpm gate` before handoff.
```

The body is Markdown; the structured fields are front-matter. A round-trip
between `*.ump.md` and `*.ump.json` MUST be lossless for L2 fields.

---

## 7. Conformance

| Level | MUST support |
|-------|--------------|
| **L0 Portable Record** | Parse + emit `*.ump.json` / `*.ump.md`; honor `consent.redact` on export. |
| **L1 Core** | L0 + `capabilities`, `recall`, `remember`, `get`; all 5 kinds; one binding. |
| **L2 Standard** | L1 + `revise`, `forget`; bi-temporal `valid_at`; provenance; scope + consent enforcement. |
| **L3 Full** | L2 + `feedback`, `subscribe`; integrity verify on read & sign on write; capability tokens; injection-resistant rehydration. |

A product states e.g. "UMP 0.1 / L2 / MCP+file bindings". Test vectors and a
conformance suite ship with the reference implementation (see ADOPTION.md).

---

## 8. Open questions (for RFC)

1. **Entity graph**: standardize an `entity:` node format, or keep it engine-only
   behind `relations`? (Recall + oktapod both have rich graphs.)
2. **Embeddings**: store raw text + source-model only (re-embed downstream, per
   MIF), or also allow shipping vectors with a model tag?
3. **Consolidation/"rethinking"**: out of scope (engine-side) - or a standard
   optional `consolidate` op so any harness can trigger another's maintenance?
4. **Decay**: keep as opaque hint, or define 2-3 named decay models for portability?
5. **Naming/governance**: final name, steward, and license (see ADOPTION.md §5).
